REQ-ID:NFR08
Description:The product shall record an appointment in such a way that it will be intuitive for the average office worker.
Type:Usability
Rationale:The users are part-time office staff with average experience in using office applications,so the usability of the product should not require any training.
Fit Criterion:80 % of users should be able to record an appointment without referring to the on-line help or requiring any training.
Originator:Carol (Office Manager)
Comments: [Duncan Bain] Initial draft
[Sachin Prabhu] Looks fine to me.
[JSB] I agree this is a good non-functional requirement.
[LMLopez] Good requirement, although it can be more precise in the "user" term used in the fit criterion: 80% of the use base, composed by receptionists, should be able to..
[Miroslav Cosic] To the contrary, I was left with the impression that the receptionists were long-term staff. For such workers, a hard-to-learn but easy-to-use interface is much more desirable than an interface that 80% of people can use with no training. It’s keyboard shortcuts and charms (both of which require reading the manual) vs. step-by-step wizards. Hence, I wish we could reconsider this NFR and its fit criteria.
[Philip Mularo] For me the fit criterion for this NFR seems appropriate for the office context - as the staff are part-time there would be less time available to train them in using the new system, but there would be a need for them to be recording appointments without hold-ups from day one.

[Glen Pinner] The description could specify who is recording the appointment. It may be only the receptionists who do this. Ditto for the rationale and the fit criterion Otherwise the fit criterion is fine.
[Ken King] This is good. I don't think you can assume it will be just receptionists using the system so the fit criterion seems appropriate to me.
[Ben Green] Although like Miroslav I think it would be nice to create a feature rich product with a steep learning curve, I also have to agree with other comments that we need to take into account the other members of staff who may need to use this product infrequently. This could be Carole or the therapists if they're covering an absent receptionist, and something as fundamental as recording bookings must be performed immediately on the system.
[Giovanni Macciocu] I think this is good. In addition to the provided comments I would like to add that I think that irrelevant of the staff type (part-time office staff with average exp ..), from an application with relatively low complexity, a certain usability level might be expected.
