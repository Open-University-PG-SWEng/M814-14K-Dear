REQ-ID:NFR21
Description: The product shall ensure that the therapists take their legally required breaks
Type: Legal Requirements
Rationale: The business has its own policy on employee breaks which will determine the scheduling of appointments however the product must also ensure that these must comply with their legal obligations. 
Fit Criterion: The  product shall schedule appointments at intervals that ensure that the business complies with working hours requirements as set out at in the Working Time Regulations 1998 Act  (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/1833/contents/made).
Originator: Carol (Office Manager)
Comments: [Ken King] Initial draft.
[Luismi López] Good work, although I would rephrase the description to be more precise: the product shall ensure therapists' scheduled appointments fully comply with their legally required breaks.
[Sachin Prabhu] This is a functional requirement. We need to document a non functional requirement.
[Duncan Bain] A good non-functional requirement. I agree with Luismi's comment.
[JSB] I also agree with Luismi's comment, but other than that it's a good non-functional requirement.
[Miroslav Cosic] Another vote to keep this as a NFR and to change the wording as Lusimi proposed. The product can only ensure that legally required breaks are scheduled, but it cannot stop people from working.
