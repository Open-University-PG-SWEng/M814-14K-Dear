REQ-ID:NFR21
Description: The product shall ensure that the therapists take their legally required breaks
Type: Legal Requirements
Rationale: The business has its own policy on employee breaks which will determine the scheduling of appointments however the product must also ensure that these must comply with their legal obligations. 
Fit Criterion: The  product shall schedule appointments at intervals that ensure that the business complies with working hours requirements as set out at in the Working Time Regulations 1998 Act  (http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/1833/contents/made).
Originator: Carol (Office Manager)
Comments: [Ken King] Initial draft.
[Luismi López] Good work, although I would rephrase the description to be more precise: the product shall ensure therapists' scheduled appointments fully comply with their legally required breaks.
[Sachin Prabhu] This is a functional requirement. We need to document a non functional requirement.
[Duncan Bain] A good non-functional requirement. I agree with Luismi's comment.
[JSB] I also agree with Luismi's comment, but other than that it's a good non-functional requirement.
[Miroslav Cosic] Another vote to keep this as a NFR and to change the wording as Lusimi proposed. The product can only ensure that legally required breaks are scheduled, but it cannot stop people from working.
[Philip Mularo] Me too - I agree with Luismi's proposed rephrasing of the description of this NFR.
[Glen Pinner] Only comment is regarding the description - possibly reword along the lines of ensuring that appointments are booked so that therapists are obliged to take breaks. Good fit criterion.
[Ben Green] I agree with above comments. The decsription of this NFR is almost identical to the corresponding FR, which perhaps should not be the case.
Overall I think it's a really good NFR, as building functionality into the product that helps the business meet legal obligations is of great benefit to the customer, and demonstrates good creativeness in design.
Perhaps the Fit Criterion should just declare an absolute time interval to prevent any ambiguity. Clearly the leglislation might be subject to change, but this might lead to uncertainty, and arguably developers just want fixed values to work on.
[Kevin Faulkner] Fit Criterion is written like a requirement, prefer something like 'appointment schedule will comply...'. Is it product requirement or requirement of business to comply with working time regulations. If there is a business policy it is not unreasonable to expect this to comply with any legal obligations, if not then does not need to be in rationale.
