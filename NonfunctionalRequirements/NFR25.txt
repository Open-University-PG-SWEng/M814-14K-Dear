[Sachin Prabhu] Initial draft
[Duncan Bain] The type is performance (speed), so I would expect a measure of time as a fit criterion. It is not clear what actions are referred to and how long they may take to perform. I can see were you are coming from, but I don't think the description and the fit criterion match each other.
[JSB] I agree with Duncan, I would include some time based limit in the fit criterion.
[LMLopez] I agree with Duncan, it is unclear whether requirement refers to performance or usability. I would also recommend to use the numeric reference in page 393 of MRP for Type: 12 Performance, or 11 Usability and humanity
