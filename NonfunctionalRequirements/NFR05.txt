REQ-ID:NFR05
Description: The product shall accurately transfer all financial transaction details to the accounts system.
Type: Performance
Rationale: Accurate records of payments for treatment must be transferred to the accounts system to enable the creation of valid invoices for insurance companies.
Fit Criterion: A transaction recorded by the appointments system must exactly match that recorded in the accounts system after a transfer has taken place.
Originator: Carol (Office Manager)
Comments: [Philip Mularo] Initial draft.
[Sachin Prabhu] I think the description descibes a functional requirement.
[Duncan Bain] This is a valid non-functional requirement: 12c Precision or Accuracy Requirements as referred to on p. 443 of MRP. I would suggest being a bit more specific about which components of the transaction must be the same. For example: amounts up to two decimals; transaction date. The definition of "transaction" can be interpreted in many ways, so an internal reference in the appointments system may not be required in the accounts system. 
[JSB] I think this is a good non-functional requirements.
[Sachin Prabhu] The example on page 296 describes a functional requirement and the fit criteria is very similar to the one listed above. I think accurracy comes into pictures when measuring or calculating values and do not apply in such cases where data needs to be copied from one system to another.
[LMLopez] Good points, Duncan, for an otherwise good requirement. Reference to the interface documentation, or specific standards may also help (i.e. Standard rounding criteria for EUR is to calculate 4 decimal points, then rounding to 2)
[Miroslav Cosic] If were to emulate the example identified by Sachin, we would remove the word “accurately” from the description and add it to the fit criterion (it may even be redundant there, as we already have “exactly” in the fit criterion). The requirement thus becomes a functional requirement that can stand on its own with respect to FR05. However, as others have pointed out (and also found on page 258 of MRP), accuracy is a valid non-functional requirement. How about rewriting this NFR to be more closely based on FR05 and to focus on accuracy? 
[Glen Pinner] Wondering if this is not a functional requirement as per MRP pp. 295-296. I tend to agree with Sachin Prabhu's although the term 'accurately' could imply the integrity of the data and is therefore a security requirement (MRP p. 262).
[Ken King] Should the fit criteria define the data required by a valid invoice? For example 'and meet the requirements necessary to create a valid invoice'
[Ben Green] Regarding the fit criterion, does the appointments system actually need to contain an exact match to the booking system ? It would be worth specifying what this match entails. I don't think the booking system needs to record all the financial details of the transaction. The original statement from the clinic owner stated "David also wants the new system to interface with the existing accounts system, which produces the invoices for the insurance companies." This doesn't mean the financial details first need typing into the appointments system, althoug there clearly has to be someone linking the corresponsing records on either system.
[Kevin Faulkner] Agree with other comments on more detail requirred for what data must match. Arguably no 'transaction' related to insurance companies takes place outside the accounts system, but guess this depens on data dictionary definition of 'transaction'. If the patient is paying then the transaction details may require transferrinf but then the rationale needs changing. 
[Elly Kelly] Ben raises a good point - surely the appointments system does not need to record anything much about any financial transactions except enough to serve as a receipt (date/time/amount) and flag the appointment as both 'attended' and 'paid for'. Plus it may be that another system such as a card reader records more details about payment. Thus a think a blanket statement "the transaction in this system should match that system" doesn't work...it does seem to need specifying with more precision.
