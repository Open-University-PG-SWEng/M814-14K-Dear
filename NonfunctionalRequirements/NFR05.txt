Originator: Carol (Office Manager)
Comments: [Philip Mularo] Initial draft.
[Sachin Prabhu] I think the description descibes a functional requirement.
[Duncan Bain] This is a valid non-functional requirement: 12c Precision or Accuracy Requirements as referred to on p. 443 of MRP. I would suggest being a bit more specific about which components of the transaction must be the same. For example: amounts up to two decimals; transaction date. The definition of ‘transaction’ can be interpreted in many ways, so an internal reference in the appointments system may not be required in the accounts system.
