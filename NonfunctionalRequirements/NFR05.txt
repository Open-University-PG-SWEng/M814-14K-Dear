Description: The product shall accurately transfer all financial transaction details to the accounts system.

Originator: Carol (Office Manager)
Comments: [Philip Mularo] Initial draft.
[Sachin Prabhu] I think the description descibes a functional requirement.
[Duncan Bain] This is a valid non-functional requirement: 12c Precision or Accuracy Requirements as referred to on p. 443 of MRP. I would suggest being a bit more specific about which components of the transaction must be the same. For example: amounts up to two decimals; transaction date. The definition of "transaction" can be interpreted in many ways, so an internal reference in the appointments system may not be required in the accounts system. 
[JSB] I think this is a good non-functional requirements.
[Sachin Prabhu] The example on page 296 describes a functional requirement and the fit criteria is very similar to the one listed above. I think accurracy comes into pictures when measuring or calculating values and do not apply in such cases where data needs to be copied from one system to another.
[LMLopez] Good points, Duncan, for an otherwise good requirement. Reference to the interface documentation, or specific standards may also help (i.e. Standard rounding criteria for EUR is to calculate 4 decimal points, then rounding to 2)
