Comments: [Miroslav Cosic] Initial draft.
[Philip Mularo] I feel this is a strong NFR. I would suggest moving the text currently in the originator section to the rationale, as I think the originator needs to be the person who suggested the requirement.
[Glen Pinner] The description and rationale refer to patients' address information. Is that the only data exchanged? Otherise both rationale and fit criterion are excellent. I see the standard is for sale from doing a quick Google search so unaware of what it contains.
