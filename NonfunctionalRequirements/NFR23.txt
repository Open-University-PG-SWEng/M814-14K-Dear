Originator: Carol (Office Manager)
Comments: [JSB] Initial draft.
[Sachin Prabhu] I think the fit criterion should be changed to point to some existing standards related to security. As described, I think the fit criterion is more suitable for a functional requirement. It may also be interpreted as proposing a solution for the requirement.
[Duncan Bain] I would suggest being more specific with the fit criterion by referencing a specific security protocol or, as Sachin suggested, reference a security standard against which the non-functional requirement can be measured.
