Description: The product shall allow a quick selection of a new appointment date
Type: Performance
Rationale: To keep the time of modifying dates to a minimum
Fit criterion: The product shall allow the selection of a new appointment date within 5 seconds 80% of the time. No new date selection should take longer than 20 seconds.
Originator: Patient/Therapist
Comments: [PW] Initial draft
[Luismi López] In my view, your requirement has been phrased as if it were a "Performance" type instead of "Usability and Humanity". In my experience, usability is demonstrated using standards or low-fidelity prototypes, then requirements reference the prototype/standard: i.e. "company usability guidelines 1.1" or "prototype version 1.1", although a textual reference can be provided i.e. "appointment dates shall be a) typed or b) selected in a calendar control, according to prototype LF-01"
[Ken King] This is good. I also thought that the "type" for this requirement was "Usability and Humanity". I am happy with the fit criterion.
[Giovanni Macciocu] I think the word "easy" in the description hints at usability while actually this is a performance requirement. Besides this minor detail I think this is good.
[Sachin Prabhu] I think the rationale can be improved upon to make it clearer. Maybe they should be two separate NFRs for quick and easy? I would delete easy and just leave quick there. The fit critereon could also be specified in terms of steps required to make the selection but this description is fine too in my opinion.
[Duncan Bain] I would also suggest that this requirement should have a type "performance" and so the description should be changed to omit "easy". I am assuming that the time refers to what the system (software) is doing and does not include the human actions of working the interface and negotiating with the patient. 
[JSB] I agree with Duncan, "easy" should be removed or separated out into it's own NFR, as the fit criterion is exclusively focused on the "quick" part.
[Miroslav Cosic] One more vote in favour of going with "quick" for performance reasons, and splitting out "easy" as a usability NFR. As for the fit criteria, I wonder whether there should be some relation to criteria for NFR01?
[Philip Mularo] I agree with the general feeling that the description should only include 'quick'. The 'Performance' type for the NFR in its current form matches the fit criterion, and the fit criterion itself is good. In the fit criterion I would maybe add a full stop after '80% of the time' so as to make 'No new date selection should take longer than 20 seconds.' into a separate sentence.
[Glen Pinner] As it stands the description points to being both a usability (easy) and performance (quick) NFR. For the fit criterion then I think the product should confirm the modification instead of just stating selection.
[Kevin Faulkner] Cannot find anything new, agree remove 'easy'. Agree fit criterion should be actual modification of date and not selection, selection does not impy change. Agree fit criterion needs splitting into two sentences to make clear which part '80% of the time' refers to, is it '5 seconds 80 % of time.'  or '80% of time no new'
[James Oram] I agree that it would be best to either remove the "easy" part or create separate NFRs for performance and usability.
[Paul Wilcox] Updated NFR with feedback from the comments.
[Marcus Wright] Agree with above, but in order to remove the ambiguity it should be split into 2 NFR’s.
