REQ-ID: NFR29
Description: The system should calculate the payment due and produce the invoice in a reasonable amount of time
Type:12
Rationale: each patient needs to pay the treatment and then leave the clinic in a reasonable amount of time so that he can carry on whith his daily schedule and no queue is created in the clinic's reception hall.
Fit Criterion: The system should present a printed invoice in less than 20 seconds in the 90% of the cases
Originator: Originator:Carol (Office Manager)

[Miroslav Cosic] I assume the fit criterion refers to the time needed to get the invoice hard copy provided that the printer is powered up and on-line? Otherwise, it may be unrealistic/non-viable. Otherwise it looks good. Minor edits: perhaps use 12a for type; say "shall" rather than "should"; "say "...in 90% of..."; remove duplicate originator label. 
[Philip Mularo] I think maybe the description specifies 2 different NFRs - the first half mentions calculating the payment due, while the second half is concerned with generating the invoice. I also wonder if 'printed' could be removed from the fit criterion, as there could be ways other than printing to output the invoice e.g. a PDF.
