Comments: [Glen Pinner] Initial draft.
[Luismi Lopez] Good work, although to improve it I would recommend to include the name and version of the accounting applications in the description, and a reference to the API documentation in the fit criterion (i.e. part number A68982-1, January 2014)
[Ken King] This is good. Perhaps the fit criterion could more explicitly define what would be considered a successful transfer of data.
[Giovanni Macciocu] I would replace "Type: 13" with an actual descriptive word to indicate the requirement type.
[Sachin Prabhu] This is a functional requirement. Not a NFR as required.
[Duncan Bain] To elaborate on Giovanni's comment, I suggest replacing 13 with 13b. Requirements for Interfacing with Adjacent Systems' as referred to on p. 447 of MRP. The word 'interface' seems more appropriate than 'interact' in the description. The fit criterion should contain the seven elements referred to in MRP.
[JSB] To avoid it sounding like a functional requirement I would recommend re-wording the description to something like "support interaction with 3rd party accounting system" then the fit criterion could be "data transfer successful using API v3, v4 and v5".
