REQ-ID:		NFR16
Description:	The list of patients who need appointment reminders should be quick and easy to generate
Type:		Usability
Rationale:	This list will probably be generated at least daily at the beginning of the day, and should be as simple as possible to use
Fit Criterion:	The system should be able to generate a list of patients who need appointment reminders with a single click
Originator:	Elly Kelly
Comments: [EK] Derived from FR16 The product should be able to generate a daily list of patients whose appointments are in less than four working day's time, sorted by date and time, which includes the patient's postal address, email and phone details [intended to be used by receptionists to phone/email or send patients appointment reminders]
[LMLopez] Good requirement, although I would recommend to include it in the description: "The list of patients referred in FR16 should be quick and easy to generate", and also using the numeric reference 11 for "Usability and Humanity" requirements (p.393 MRP). Good use of comments to clarify reference to original requirement. Maybe also some reference to usability guidelines to justify your "1 click" fit criterion (although it may be part of the supporting materials section"
