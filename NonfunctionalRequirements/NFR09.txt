Comments: [Giovanni Macciocu] Initial draft
[Duncan Bain] I would suggest including more of the original requirement description in this description, otherwise one has to go look up the original requirement to know what this non-functional requirement is about. Correct ’therpist’ to ‘therapist’. The rationale sound like an accuracy requirement while the description refers to a speed requirement. I think you were trying to say that if the therapist schedule is not updated quick enough, the time slot may be taken by someone else also entering an appointment at the same time. I think some other rationale would be more appropriate.
