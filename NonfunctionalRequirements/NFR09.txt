Comments: [Giovanni Macciocu] Initial draft
[Duncan Bain] I would suggest including more of the original requirement description in this description, otherwise one has to go look up the original requirement to know what this non-functional requirement is about. Correct 'therpist' to 'therapist'. The rationale sound like an accuracy requirement while the description refers to a speed requirement. I think you were trying to say that if the therapist schedule is not updated quick enough, the time slot may be taken by someone else also entering an appointment at the same time. I think some other rationale would be more appropriate. 
[JSB] Just to check, it's the receptionist who would be entering the new appointment for the patient with a therapist, and the schedule for the therapist must be display the new appointment within 3 seconds to ensure their un-availability is reflected and a double booking is not made
[LMLopez] I do agree completely with Duncan and JSB, except for the part of including part of FR09 in the original description, in which I dissent. A reference makes possible that changes made to FR09 do not imply a rewording of NFR09, this approach is much more precise, in my view.
