[Luismi López] In my view, your NFR11 requirement is incorrect because mixes performance (description and fit criterion "in less than 3 seconds" and usability concepts (".. show the fields to be updated in the order they should be input, enabling keyboard (tabbed) navigation.") 

It also contains technological elements "keyboard, tabbed navigation", being solution-bound.

I suggest to remove ambiguity by replacing, "the information" by "any information requested" in its description, if we are to consider it applies to the whole system.
[Ken King] This seems like a good Fit Criterion for testing 'performance' but I am not sure that it requires the additional explanation about the tabbed navigation.
