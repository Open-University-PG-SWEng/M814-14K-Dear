REQ-ID: NFR24
Description: The product shall ensure that only authorised users have access to the clinic's timetable of appointments and that an authenticated patient is only authorised to view details of their own appointments.
Type: 15 (Security)
Rationale: To ensure the confidentiality of patient related information is not compromised by unauthorised users as this could lead to the clinic being held criminally responsible for a breach in the data protection act.
Fit Criterion : An authenticated patient must only be able to view their appointments, and not the appointments of any other patient.
Originator: Carol (Office Manager)
Comments: [Ben Green] Initial Draft.
[Ken King] Perhaps the fit criterion could adhere to a relevant security standard
[Miroslav Cosic] This looks like it could be split into two security NFRs at the "and". Fit criterion is OK for the second half of the description. Rationale seems to match the first half of the description. Propose to mention section 7.8 (Access control) of BS EN ISO 27799:2008 in fit criterion.
[Giovanni Macciocu] Agree with Cosic, this is not an atomic requirement, it can be split into 2 NFRs.
[Ben Green] FR24 seems to have disappeared from origin-master, but I still have a copy in my local branch from TMA02, therefore it might help everyone understand NFR24 if I place the contents of FR24 below:
-------------
REQ-ID: FR24

Type: Functional
Rationale: To provide the client the ability to remind themselves when their upcoming appointments are and reduce the risk of 'no-shows'.
Originator: Carol (Office Manager)
Comments: [Jonathan Bullock]
-------------
[Kevin Faulkner] Agree with others first part of description is not required and can be moved into another NFR. Either that or add an unauthorised access test to fit criterion
